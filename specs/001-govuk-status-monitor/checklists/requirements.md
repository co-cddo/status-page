# Specification Quality Checklist: GOV.UK Public Services Status Monitor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21 **Updated**: 2025-10-21 (Post config.yaml analysis) **Feature**:
[spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Configuration Alignment

- [x] Specification reflects actual config.yaml structure (pings array, tags, validation)
- [x] Supports GET, HEAD, and POST methods as shown in draft config
- [x] Includes custom headers and POST payload support
- [x] Tag-based organization instead of strict hierarchy
- [x] Response validation (status code + optional text matching)
- [x] Extended with global settings (intervals, timeouts, retry logic)

## Specification Updates Applied

### Resolved Clarifications

1. **Auto-refresh interval**: Set to 60 seconds (FR-029) matching industry standard
2. **Storage backend migration**: Defined as architectural extensibility (FR-019) without
   prescriptive trigger mechanism

### Major Enhancements from config.yaml Analysis

1. Updated User Story 2 to reflect tag-based organization instead of hierarchical
2. Expanded functional requirements from 16 to 33, organized into logical sections
3. Added Configuration Structure section with complete YAML schema
4. Updated Key Entities to reflect pings, tags, and validation criteria
5. Enhanced edge cases to cover validation failures, POST requests, and tag handling
6. Revised assumptions to reflect actual capabilities (POST, headers, text validation)

## Validation Status

**Overall**: âœ… Ready for planning

**Notes**:

- All clarification markers resolved with informed decisions
- Specification now accurately reflects provided config.yaml format
- Extended configuration with sensible defaults and optional overrides
- 33 functional requirements comprehensively cover monitoring, validation, storage, and display
- Tag-based organization provides flexible multi-dimensional categorization
- Configuration structure documented with complete example schema
