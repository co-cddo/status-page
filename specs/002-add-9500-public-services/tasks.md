# Tasks: Comprehensive UK Public Service Monitoring

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-9500-public-services`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-add-9500-public-services/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. This is a **data collection and configuration feature**, not traditional software development - tasks focus on research, validation, and transformation workflows.

**Tests**: Validation scripts ensure data quality (analogous to test quality in code development). 100% validation pass rate required before services added to config.yaml.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization)

**Purpose**: Install discovery tools, create validation scripts structure, initialize research data directories

- [X] T001 Install Node.js dependencies for validation (undici, ajv, yaml, normalize-url) via npm install
- [ ] T002 [P] Install Subfinder v2.6+ via go install for DNS enumeration
- [ ] T003 [P] Install Amass v4+ via go install for comprehensive DNS discovery
- [X] T004 [P] Create research data directory structure at specs/002-add-9500-public-services/research-data/ with subdirectories: discovered/, validated/, reports/
- [X] T005 [P] Create validation scripts directory structure at scripts/ for validate-services.ts, deduplicate.ts, transform-to-yaml.ts, validate-config.ts
- [ ] T006 Configure Subfinder API keys in ~/.config/subfinder/provider-config.yaml (Censys, VirusTotal, GitHub, SecurityTrails free tier)
- [X] T007 [P] Create taxonomy.json file defining 74-tag structure across 6 dimensions (department, service-type, geography, criticality, channel, lifecycle)
- [X] T008 [P] Create categories.json file defining 15 service categories by criticality tier and department

**Checkpoint**: Tools installed, directory structure ready, taxonomy defined

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core validation infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story discovery can begin

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story discovery work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T009 Implement URL normalization script in scripts/normalize-urls.ts (RFC 3986: lowercase scheme/host, remove default ports, sort query params, remove trailing slashes)
- [X] T010 [P] Implement redirect resolution script in scripts/resolve-redirects.ts using undici with max 5 hops, circular redirect detection, redirect chain tracking
- [X] T011 [P] Implement deduplication script in scripts/deduplicate.ts using canonical URL Set for O(1) lookup, mark is_duplicate flag
- [X] T012 [P] Implement accessibility validation script in scripts/validate-accessibility.ts with HTTP status checks (200/301/302/401/403 = accessible), latency measurement, retry logic (3 attempts)
- [ ] T013 Implement tag application script in scripts/apply-tags.ts reading taxonomy.json, applying tags by department/service-type/geography/criticality/channel/lifecycle
- [ ] T014 [P] Implement service entry transformation script in scripts/transform-to-entries.ts converting Discovered Services to Service Entry format per data-model.md
- [ ] T015 [P] Implement category grouping script in scripts/group-by-category.ts organizing services by 15 predefined categories from categories.json
- [ ] T016 Implement YAML generation script in scripts/generate-yaml.ts using yaml package (eemeli) with programmatic comment insertion, section headers
- [ ] T017 [P] Implement JSON Schema validation script in scripts/validate-schema.ts using ajv to validate discovered-services.json against contracts/service-discovery-api.json
- [X] T018 Implement config.yaml validation script in scripts/validate-config.ts to verify final config against existing JSON Schema
- [X] T019 [P] Create research progress reporting script in scripts/generate-report.ts for statistics (total discovered, validation pass/fail, coverage by department/type)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all validation and transformation scripts operational - user story discovery can now begin in parallel

**Independent Test**: Verify that config.yaml uses consistent tagging taxonomy and status page groups/filters services by these tags

**Implementation Strategy**: Validate and refine tag application across all user stories

### Taxonomy Refinement for User Story 8

- [ ] T142 [US8] Review all tagged services from US1-US7, identify inconsistent tag usage in research-data/reports/tag-usage-analysis.md
- [ ] T143 [US8] Validate tag hierarchy (parent-child relationships, no circular dependencies) using scripts/validate-taxonomy.ts
- [ ] T144 [US8] Generate tag usage statistics (service count per tag, top 20 most-used tags) using scripts/generate-report.ts
- [ ] T145 [US8] Review and standardize geography tags (uk-wide vs country-specific vs local-authority-*) across all services
- [ ] T146 [US8] Review and standardize service-type tags (application vs booking vs portal vs case-management) for clarity
- [ ] T147 [US8] Verify all services have minimum 2 tags and maximum 10 tags per data-model.md validation rules
- [ ] T148 [US8] Verify criticality tag distribution (critical: emergency only, high-volume: HMRC/DVLA/DWP/NHS, standard: others)
- [ ] T149 [US8] Document final taxonomy in research-data/reports/taxonomy-final.md with usage counts and examples

**Checkpoint**: User Story 8 complete - consistent taxonomy applied across all 9500+ services

---

## Phase 11: User Story 9 - Service Research and Documentation (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Create structured research outputs documenting discovered services, endpoints, validation criteria, organizational ownership, and discovery sources for maintainability

**Independent Test**: Verify that research outputs include service URLs, expected status codes, validation text patterns, ownership departments, and discovery sources

**Implementation Strategy**: Generate comprehensive documentation from research artifacts

### Documentation for User Story 9

- [ ] T150 [P] [US9] Generate comprehensive research report summarizing all discovery sources used (DNS, CT logs, web search, manual review) in research-data/reports/discovery-methodology.md
- [ ] T151 [P] [US9] Generate service ownership mapping (URL ‚Üí department/agency) in research-data/reports/service-ownership.csv
- [ ] T152 [P] [US9] Generate excluded services report (services discovered but excluded with reasons: internal-only, deprecated, duplicates) in research-data/reports/excluded-services.md
- [ ] T153 [P] [US9] Generate validation criteria rationale report (complex services with text validation patterns, POST payloads) in research-data/reports/validation-rationale.md
- [ ] T154 [US9] Generate discovery timeline (when services were discovered, by which method) in research-data/reports/discovery-timeline.csv
- [ ] T155 [US9] Generate final statistics report (total discovered, validated, added to config, success criteria verification) in research-data/reports/final-statistics.md

**Checkpoint**: User Story 9 complete - comprehensive documentation generated for long-term maintainability

---

## Phase 12: Final Integration and Quality Verification

**Purpose**: Merge all user story outputs, validate against success criteria, verify 9500+ service requirement met

- [ ] T156 Merge all user story YAML files (government-services.yaml, nhs-services.yaml, emergency-services.yaml, local-gov-services.yaml, third-party-services.yaml, services-gov-uk.yaml, justice-services.yaml) into single config-additions.yaml with proper section ordering by criticality tier
- [ ] T157 Validate merged config-additions.yaml against JSON Schema using scripts/validate-config.ts (zero schema errors required)
- [ ] T158 Verify total service count meets SC-001 (minimum 9500 unique endpoints) using jq query on merged file
- [ ] T159 Verify major department coverage meets SC-002 (minimum 50 services per HMRC, DVLA, DWP, NHS, Home Office, MOJ) using scripts/generate-report.ts
- [ ] T160 Verify UK health systems coverage meets SC-003 (NHS England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland represented) using tag filtering
- [ ] T161 Verify emergency services coverage meets SC-004 (minimum 100 emergency service endpoints) using tag filtering
- [ ] T162 Verify local government coverage meets SC-005 (minimum 200 local government endpoints) using tag filtering
- [ ] T163 Verify *.services.gov.uk coverage meets SC-006 (minimum 50 unique subdomains) using domain filtering
- [ ] T164 Verify third-party coverage meets SC-007 (minimum 100 third-party endpoints) using tag filtering
- [ ] T165 Verify tag taxonomy coverage meets SC-012 (at least 50 unique tags used) using scripts/generate-report.ts
- [ ] T166 Check config-additions.yaml file size is under 5MB target to meet maintainability requirements
- [ ] T167 Generate final research report documenting methodology reproducibility (SC-011) in research-data/reports/research-methodology-final.md
- [ ] T168 Manual review of config-additions.yaml for YAML syntax correctness, comment quality, section organization
- [ ] T169 Backup existing config.yaml to config-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).yaml before merge
- [ ] T170 Merge config-additions.yaml into config.yaml at appropriate section locations (Tier 1 Critical, Tier 2 High-Volume, Tier 3 Standard)
- [ ] T171 Run full config.yaml validation after merge using scripts/validate-config.ts
- [ ] T172 Commit config.yaml changes to feature branch 002-add-9500-public-services with descriptive commit message documenting total services added and coverage achieved

**Checkpoint**: All 9500+ services validated, merged into config.yaml, all success criteria verified, ready for pull request

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Stories 1-3 (P1 - Government, NHS, Emergency): Can proceed in parallel after Foundational complete
  - User Stories 4-7 (P2 - Local Gov, Third-Party, services.gov.uk, Justice): Can proceed in parallel after Foundational complete
  - User Stories 8-9 (P3 - Taxonomy, Documentation): Depend on US1-US7 data collection
- **Final Integration (Phase 12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete (US1-US9 for full 9500+ coverage)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Government)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1 - NHS)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P1 - Emergency)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1-US2
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Local Gov)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1-US3
- **User Story 5 (P2 - Third-Party)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1-US4
- **User Story 6 (P2 - services.gov.uk)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1-US5
- **User Story 7 (P2 - Justice)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1-US6
- **User Story 8 (P3 - Taxonomy)**: Depends on US1-US7 tag data - Cannot start until tag application complete
- **User Story 9 (P3 - Documentation)**: Depends on US1-US7 research data - Can start as US1-US7 complete

### Within Each User Story

- Discovery tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different discovery methods)
- Validation and transformation must run sequentially: normalization ‚Üí redirect resolution ‚Üí deduplication ‚Üí accessibility validation ‚Üí tag application ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí grouping ‚Üí YAML generation
- YAML validation must complete before moving to next user story

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003, T004, T005, T007, T008)
- All Foundational scripts marked [P] can run in parallel (T010-T019 after T009 completes)
- User Stories 1-7 can all start in parallel after Foundational phase (maximum parallelization)
- Within each user story, all discovery tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- US8 and US9 can run in parallel once US1-US7 complete

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Government Services)

```bash
# Launch all discovery tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task T020: "DNS enumeration for *.services.gov.uk using subfinder"
Task T021: "Certificate Transparency query for %.services.gov.uk"
Task T022: "DNS enumeration for *.gov.uk using amass"
Task T023: "Web search discovery for HMRC services"
Task T024: "Web search discovery for DVLA services"
Task T025: "Web search discovery for DWP services"
Task T026: "Web search discovery for Home Office services"
Task T027: "Web search discovery for MOJ/HMCTS services"
Task T028: "Web search discovery for DfE services"
Task T029: "Web search discovery for DEFRA services"
Task T030: "Web search discovery for Companies House and IPO services"

# All 11 discovery tasks can run concurrently (estimated 20-30 minutes total vs 3+ hours sequential)
```

---

## Parallel Example: Multiple User Stories

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch all P1 user stories in parallel:
Agent 1: Execute User Story 1 (Government Services Discovery)
Agent 2: Execute User Story 2 (NHS and Healthcare Services)
Agent 3: Execute User Story 3 (Emergency Services)

# All 3 agents can work independently, discovering and validating services in parallel
# Estimated time: 4-6 hours parallel vs 12-18 hours sequential
```

4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (NHS across all 4 health systems)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Emergency Services - police, fire, ambulance)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Merge US1-US3 YAML, verify minimum coverage thresholds
7. Estimated services from US1-US3: 3000-5000 services (critical + high-volume tiers)

### Incremental Delivery (All User Stories for 9500+ Coverage)

2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Researcher A: User Story 1 (Government Services)
   - Researcher B: User Story 2 (NHS Services)
   - Researcher C: User Story 3 (Emergency Services)
   - Researcher D: User Story 4 (Local Government)
   - Researcher E: User Story 6 (*.services.gov.uk comprehensive)
3. Stories complete independently, merge incrementally
4. User Stories 8-9 (Taxonomy + Documentation) after US1-US7 data collected

- User Stories 1-7 in parallel: 20 hours max (2.5 days)
- User Stories 8-9: 8 hours (1 day)
- Final Integration: 4 hours (0.5 days)
- **Total: 6-7 working days with team of 5**

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files/discovery sources, no dependencies - run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Research data in research-data/ directory is ephemeral (not committed to repository)
- Only final config.yaml is committed to repository
- Validation pass rate: 100% required before services added to config.yaml
- Service count targets are minimums - exhaustive discovery should continue beyond thresholds
- Commit after each user story completion or logical checkpoint
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding

---

## Total Task Count

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 8 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 11 tasks
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 22 tasks (T020-T041)
