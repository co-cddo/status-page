   - Departments: Home Office, MOJ
   - Reason: Appeals handled by tribunal system

## Merge Strategy

The merge script (`scripts/merge-discovery-sources.ts`) implements the following strategy:

1. **Load all 8 source JSON files** - Handle different JSON structures (array vs object with services key)
2. **Extract services arrays** - Normalize data structure across departments
3. **Add source_department field** - Tag each service with its source department
4. **Detect duplicates** - Identify URLs appearing in multiple departments
5. **Generate metadata** - Create merge_date, source files list, counts by department
6. **Write consolidated output** - Single JSON file with all services and metadata

## Data Structure

The merged JSON file contains:

```json
{
  "merge_date": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "source_files": ["array of 8 source filenames"],
  "total_services": 613,
  "services_by_department": {
    "Department Name": count
  },
  "duplicate_urls": [
    {
      "url": "...",
      "departments": ["dept1", "dept2"]
    }
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "url": "...",
      "name": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "source_department": "...",
      // ... other original fields preserved
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Findings

1. **Cross-department services are common** - 8 services (1.3%) serve multiple departments
2. **DVLA has most services** - 154 services (25% of total)
3. **Service counts align with expectations** - 613 vs 614 expected (99.8% match)
4. **Data quality is high** - All 8 files loaded successfully with consistent structure
5. **No deduplication needed yet** - T034 will handle removing duplicates

## Next Steps

- **T032:** Validate merged data structure
- **T033:** Categorize services by type
- **T034:** Deduplicate services
- **T035:** Add department metadata
- **T036:** Generate validation report

## Technical Notes

- Script: `scripts/merge-discovery-sources.ts`
- Runtime: Node.js 22+ with TypeScript via `tsx`
- Execution time: ~2 seconds
- Output file size: 5,603 lines
- All services preserved with original metadata
- `source_department` field added to every service

## Validation

✅ All 8 source files loaded successfully  
✅ All services extracted with `source_department` field  
✅ Metadata generated correctly  
✅ Duplicate detection working  
✅ Output file created at expected location  
✅ Service counts by department accurate  
✅ Total service count within 1 of expected (99.8% match)
