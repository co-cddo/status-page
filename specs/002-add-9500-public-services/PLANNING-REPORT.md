**Sections**: 9 (Overview, Entity Diagrams, 6 Core Entities, Data Flow, Storage Schema, TypeScript Types, References)

**Core Entities Documented**:

1. **Discovered Service** (intermediate JSON format)
   - 19 attributes including url, canonical_url, tags[], discovery_source
   - Validation rules for 9500+ service scale
   - State transitions: Discovered → Canonical → Validated → Categorized → Service Entry

2. **Service Entry** (final config.yaml format)
   - Maps to existing monitoring system schema
   - Transformed from Discovered Service after validation

3. **Research Source**
   - 10 discovery methods (dns-enumeration, web-search, manual, etc.)
   - Reproducibility metadata (search_query, tool_version)

4. **Tag Taxonomy**
   - 74 tags across 6 dimensions
   - Hierarchical structure (max 2 levels)
   - Categories: department, service-type, geography, criticality, channel, lifecycle

5. **Service Category**
   - 15 predefined categories for config.yaml organization
   - Display order by criticality tier (critical → high-volume → standard)

6. **Validation Result**
   - Accessibility validation outcomes
   - Retry logic for network errors (0-3 attempts)

**Entity Relationships Diagram**:
```
Discovery Strategy → Research Source → Discovered Service → Validation Result
                                              ↓
                                        Tag Taxonomy → Service Category
                                              ↓
                                        Service Entry (config.yaml)
```

#### 2. contracts/service-discovery-api.json

**Format**: JSON Schema draft-07
**Size**: ~8KB
**Definitions**: 6 (DiscoveredService, ResearchSource, ValidationResult, TagTaxonomy, ServiceCategory, CustomHeader)

**Validation Features**:
- Conditional schemas (if/then/else for duplicate_of, post_payload)

- Pattern validation (lowercase hyphenated tags, RFC 3986 URLs)
- Range validation (expected_status 100-599, check_interval 10-86400)
- Array constraints (tags min 2, max 10, unique items)

**Usage**: Validates discovered-services.json before transformation to config.yaml

#### 3. quickstart.md

## Constitution Compliance Analysis

### Modified Interpretations (Justified)

**Principle III: Test-Driven Development**

**Standard**: Write tests before implementation, 100% pass rate

**Modified for Data Collection**:
- ✅ Validation scripts replace unit tests (same quality gate)
- ✅ 100% validation pass rate required before adding to config.yaml
- ✅ Scripts validate: URL accessibility, redirect following, deduplication, schema conformance
- ⚠️ Traditional TDD Red-Green-Refactor: N/A (no application code development)

**Justification**: This is exhaustive research/data collection, not software feature development. Validation scripts ensure data quality (analogous to test quality in code development).

---

**Principle X: Mock Services for Testing**

**Standard**: Tests MUST NOT call external services

**Modified for Data Collection**:
- ⚠️ Real HTTP requests REQUIRED to verify public accessibility
- ✅ Rate limiting enforced (10s GOV.UK, 5s NHS.UK per robots.txt)
- ✅ Conservative retry logic (exponential backoff with full jitter)
- ✅ Connection pooling to avoid overwhelming services

**Justification**: Cannot mock external services when the goal IS to validate external service accessibility. Mitigated with respectful rate limiting and retry patterns.

---

**Principle VIII: Research-Driven Technical Decisions**

**Standard**: Research before implementing using Context7, WebSearch, WebFetch, Perplexity

**Full Compliance**:
- ✅ 10 research tasks dispatched to research-expert agents
- ✅ 200+ sources cited across DNS tools, HTTP clients, validation, taxonomy
- ✅ WebSearch extensively used (no token cost)
- ✅ Perplexity used judiciously for complex architectural decisions
- ✅ Context7 used for library documentation (undici, ajv, yaml)

**Result**: research.md (135KB) documents all technology decisions with rationale

---

### Principles Fully Satisfied

- ✅ **Principle I (GDS Design System)**: Not applicable (data collection, not UI)
- ✅ **Principle II (Accessibility)**: Not applicable (no user-facing code)
- ✅ **Principle IV (Progressive Enhancement)**: Not applicable (no frontend)
- ✅ **Principle V (Performance Budgets)**: Satisfied (pipeline ~3-5 min for 9500 services)
- ✅ **Principle VI (Component Quality)**: Satisfied (JSON Schema validation, ajv)
- ✅ **Principle VII (User Research)**: Satisfied (13 success criteria, 7 user stories)
- ✅ **Principle IX (No Test Skipping)**: Satisfied (validation scripts required, no skipping)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Service Discovery Falls Short of 9500 Minimum

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High (blocks success criteria)

**Mitigations**:
- Multi-source discovery (DNS, CT logs, web search, directories)
- Breadth-first strategy ensures minimum coverage across categories
- Exhaustive continuation beyond 9500 (no upper limit)
- Manual fallback for under-represented categories

---

### Risk 2: Rate Limiting by Government Services

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (slows validation)

**Mitigations**:
- Conservative rate limits (10s GOV.UK, 5s NHS.UK)
- Connection pooling (50 connections/host max)
- Exponential backoff with full jitter
- Retry logic (0-3 attempts)
- Batch processing option if needed

---

### Risk 3: Deduplication Misses Duplicates

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Low (config.yaml bloat, not critical)

**Mitigations**:
- Multi-phase deduplication (normalization → redirect → canonical)
- Circular redirect detection (visited Set)
- Manual review of high-volume departments (HMRC, NHS)
- Post-generation validation script

---

### Risk 4: YAML Generation Exceeds 5MB Target

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Low (performance degradation)

**Mitigations**:
- Current config.yaml: 2080 lines (~100KB for ~200 services)
- Projected: 9500 services × ~300 bytes = ~2.85MB (well under 5MB)
- Compression option if needed (gzip)
- Truncate notes/comments if size becomes issue

---

### Risk 5: Validation Scripts Have Bugs

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (incorrect data in config.yaml)

**Mitigations**:
- JSON Schema validation enforces structure
- Manual spot checks (random sample 100 services)
- Peer review of generated config-additions.yaml
- Test deployment to staging environment first

---

## Key Decisions Log

### Technology Selections

1. **DNS Enumeration**: Subfinder (primary) + Amass (secondary)
   - **Rationale**: Subfinder 40x faster, Amass more thorough as backup
   - **Alternative Considered**: dnsenum, fierce (rejected: slower, fewer sources)

2. **HTTP Client**: undici v7+
   - **Rationale**: 3x faster than axios, native redirect tracking, Node.js core
   - **Alternative Considered**: axios (rejected: slower, bloated), node-fetch (rejected: no redirect tracking)

3. **JSON Schema Validator**: ajv v8+
   - **Rationale**: 14M validations/sec when compiled, industry standard
   - **Alternative Considered**: joi (rejected: 8900x slower), zod (rejected: TypeScript-only)

4. **YAML Generator**: yaml (eemeli)
   - **Rationale**: Only library supporting programmatic comment insertion
   - **Alternative Considered**: js-yaml (rejected: cannot preserve/generate comments)

5. **Tag Taxonomy**: 74-tag flat structure
   - **Rationale**: Balances specificity vs maintainability, covers 6 key dimensions
   - **Alternative Considered**: Hierarchical tree (rejected: complex queries), free-form (rejected: inconsistency)

### Process Decisions

1. **Discovery Strategy**: Breadth-first, then depth by criticality
   - **Rationale**: Ensures minimum coverage across categories before deepening
   - **Alternative Considered**: Depth-first by department (rejected: risks missing categories)

2. **Deduplication**: Redirect resolution to canonical URL
   - **Rationale**: Most accurate representation of actual service
   - **Alternative Considered**: Keep shortest URL (rejected: may not be canonical)

3. **Validation Acceptance**: 200/301/302/401/403 as accessible
   - **Rationale**: Auth-protected services still monitorable (login page checks)
   - **Alternative Considered**: 200 only (rejected: excludes auth services)

4. **YAML Organization**: Criticality tier → Department → Service Type → Alphabetical
   - **Rationale**: Prioritizes most critical services in file structure
   - **Alternative Considered**: Alphabetical only (rejected: loses criticality context)
