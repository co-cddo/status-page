## Reviewer Comments

This specification represents an exceptionally large-scale data collection and configuration task. Key strengths:

1. **Clear scope boundaries**: Distinguishes between production services, internal services, and out-of-scope items
2. **Realistic success criteria**: Measurable targets (9500+ services, 50+ departments, 100+ emergency services)
3. **Comprehensive research methodology**: Multiple discovery strategies documented
4. **Scalability considerations**: Performance requirements for 9500+ service monitoring
5. **Quality validation**: Built-in validation requirements (FR-063 through FR-068)

Ready to proceed with planning and implementation.
