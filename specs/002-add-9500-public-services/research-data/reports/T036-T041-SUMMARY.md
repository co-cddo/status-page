#### Major Department Coverage (Target: 50+ services each)
| Department | Count | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| HMRC | 49 | ✗ FAIL (1 short) |
| DVLA | 59 | ✓ PASS |
| DWP | 20 | ✗ FAIL (30 short) |
| Home Office | 35 | ✗ FAIL (15 short) |

**Note**: Only DVLA meets the 50+ services threshold. HMRC is close (49). Coverage limited by validated dataset size (289 services total, with 281 passing validation).

## File Outputs

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| government-services-tagged.json | 218 KB | Tagged services with taxonomy |
| government-service-entries.json | (generated) | Service Entry format |
| government-services.yaml | 100 KB | Final YAML configuration |
| reports/government-services-coverage.md | (generated) | Coverage analysis |

## Key Findings

1. **Service Distribution**: 281 validated services tagged and transformed
2. **Department Coverage**: DVLA (59) exceeds target, HMRC (49) nearly meets target, DWP (20) and Home Office (35) below target
3. **Criticality**: Majority (57.3%) are high-volume tier services
4. **Validation**: All 281 services pass JSON Schema validation
5. **YAML Quality**: Well-formatted with proper section headers and comments

## Issues & Warnings

1. **Coverage Gap**: Only 1 of 4 major departments (DVLA) meets 50+ services requirement
   - Root cause: Limited validated dataset (289 total services)
   - HMRC: 49 services (just 1 short of target)
   - DWP: 20 services (30 short of target)
   - Home Office: 35 services (15 short of target)

2. **"other-government" Category**: 114 services (40.6%) couldn't be categorized to specific departments
   - Indicates need for improved department detection logic

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Discovery**: Run additional web searches for DWP and Home Office services to reach 50+ threshold
2. **Refine Tagging**: Review 114 "other-government" services and improve department identification
3. **HMRC**: Add 1+ more HMRC service to reach 50 threshold
4. **Validation Pipeline**: Consider running full accessibility validation on larger discovered dataset (613 services from T031 merge)

## Next Steps

- Phase 3 User Story 1 checkpoint reached
- Services ready for review and potential config.yaml merge
- Consider expanding discovery for underrepresented departments before proceeding to User Story 2 (NHS Services)
