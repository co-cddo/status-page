  "notes": "Discovery methodology: Conducted comprehensive WebSearch across GOV.UK domains for DWP digital services including Universal Credit, benefits, pensions, employment support, and related services. Used WebFetch to explore key landing pages. Discovered 76 unique DWP service URLs, exceeding the 50-service target. Services include online applications, account management portals, calculators, information pages, and support tools. Coverage includes main benefits (Universal Credit, PIP, ESA, JSA), pension services (State Pension, Pension Credit, pension tracing), specialist benefits (maternity, bereavement, disability), employment services (Find a Job, Access to Work, Jobcentre Plus), and administrative services (Tell Us Once, appeals, overpayments). Most services offer online access either through direct applications or account management portals. Some legacy benefits (Housing Benefit, Tax Credits) are being replaced by Universal Credit but still serve existing claimants. Several services are managed jointly with HMRC (Child Benefit, Help to Save, National Insurance) but involve DWP coordination."
