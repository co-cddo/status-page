  "notes": "Successfully discovered 150 unique DVLA digital services across www.gov.uk domain. The discovery focused on:\n\n1. Core transactional services (apply, renew, replace, change)\n2. Information and checking services (view, check, track)\n3. Specialized services (professional drivers, blue badge, motor trade)\n4. Administrative services (notifications, data requests)\n5. Learning and testing services (theory, practical tests)\n6. Teaching and instructor services (ADI registration)\n7. Enforcement and reporting services\n\nDiscovery Methods:\n- WebSearch: Used targeted site:www.gov.uk searches for DVLA-related terms\n- WebFetch: Systematically extracted service URLs from official GOV.UK browse pages\n- Manual review: Categorized and deduplicated services\n\nKey Findings:\n- Most DVLA services are hosted on www.gov.uk domain (not *.service.gov.uk)\n- Services span 13 major categories\n- Mix of transactional services (65%) and information services (35%)\n- Strong digital-first approach with most services available online\n- Driver and vehicles account (https://www.gov.uk/driver-vehicles-account) acts as central portal\n- Comprehensive coverage of driving licences, vehicle tax, MOT checks, and registration services\n\nChallenges:\n- *.service.gov.uk subdomain searches returned no results - DVLA uses main www.gov.uk domain\n- Some services overlap (e.g., change address appears in both licence and vehicle contexts)\n- Distinction between 'service' and 'information page' required manual judgment\n\nAll 150 services are production-ready, public-facing digital services with full HTTPS URLs.",
