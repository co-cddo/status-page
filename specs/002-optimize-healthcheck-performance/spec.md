# Feature Specification: Optimize Healthcheck Performance

**Feature Branch**: `002-optimize-healthcheck-performance`  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "currently the healthcheck is now taking around 30mins, this is too long, target for `time pnpm run check-once` to complete is under 2 minutes, use the config.yaml from the 002-add-9500-public-services branch for benchmarking. carry out extensive research into approaches"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Fast Healthchecks (Priority: P1)

As a developer/operator, I want the healthcheck process to complete quickly so that I can get timely feedback on the system's health.

**Why this priority**: The current 30-minute runtime is too long and hinders rapid feedback and deployment cycles.

**Independent Test**: Run the `pnpm run check-once` command and verify that it completes in under 2 minutes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** I execute `pnpm run check-once`, **Then** the command should exit successfully within 2 minutes.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST execute all health checks as defined in `config.yaml`.
- **FR-002**: The health check process MUST complete in under 2 minutes when benchmarked with the `config.yaml` from the `002-add-9500-public-services` branch.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide a clear success or failure status for the entire health check run.
- **FR-004**: The health check mechanism MUST be extensible to support new checks in the future.
- **FR-005**: The health check results MUST be accurate and reflect the true state of the monitored services.
- **FR-006**: The solution MUST be researched and chosen from a range of potential approaches. The primary research avenue will be to focus on parallelizing health checks (e.g., using worker threads or child processes).

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Observability

- **NFR-OBS-001**: The system MUST only log critical errors that prevent the health check from completing.

#### Scalability

- **NFR-SCL-001**: The solution MUST support up to 500 concurrent health checks.

### Edge Cases

- If a health check for a single service times out, that service MUST be marked as 'failed', but the overall health check process MUST continue for the remaining services.
- If the health check runner itself fails completely, it MUST immediately report a critical failure for the entire health check process.
- If the `config.yaml` is malformed or missing, the system MUST fail to start and log a clear error message indicating the problem.

### Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Assumption**: The `config.yaml` from the `002-add-9500-public-services` branch is available and represents a realistic load for benchmarking.
- **Dependency**: The underlying infrastructure (network, etc.) is stable during the health check execution.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The `pnpm run check-once` command execution time is reduced from ~30 minutes to under 2 minutes.
- **SC-002**: The health check success/failure rate remains consistent with the baseline before optimization.
- **SC-003**: The resource utilization (CPU, memory) during the health check process does not exceed acceptable limits. Resource utilization should be kept below 80% of the available system resources.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-27

- Q: How should the system behave when a single health check times out? → A: Mark the individual service as 'failed' and continue with other checks.
- Q: How does the system handle a complete failure of the health check runner itself? → A: Immediately report a critical failure for the entire health check process.
- Q: What happens if the `config.yaml` is malformed or missing? → A: Fail to start and log a clear error message.
- Q: What level of detail should be logged during the health check process? → A: Only log critical errors that prevent the health check from completing.
- Q: What is the anticipated upper limit of concurrent checks the new solution should support? → A: The solution should support up to 500 concurrent health checks.
