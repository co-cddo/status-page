# Integration Tests Summary - User Story 1 Orchestrator Workflows

## Completed Tasks

This document summarizes the comprehensive integration tests created for User Story 1 orchestrator
workflows.

### Task T033b - Worker Pool Integration Test

**File**: `tests/integration/worker-pool-integration.test.ts` **Status**: Complete **Lines**: ~280

**Test Coverage**:

- Real worker thread execution with actual HTTP requests to httpbin.org

- Correlation ID propagation through worker execution
- Worker failure handling and graceful degradation
- Load testing with 10+ concurrent health checks
- Queue management and task overflow scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. Execute health checks using real worker threads

3. Handle network timeouts properly
4. Execute multiple checks in parallel
5. Handle worker pool exhaustion and queuing
6. Propagate correlation IDs end-to-end
7. Handle worker failures gracefully
8. Load test with 15 concurrent health checks
9. Sustained load testing across multiple batches

**Network Requests**: Uses httpbin.org for reliable test endpoints **Timeout**: Up to 120 seconds
for load tests

### Task T034b - Scheduler Integration Test

**File**: `tests/integration/scheduler-integration.test.ts` **Status**: Complete **Lines**: ~240

**Test Coverage**:

- Scheduler triggers worker pool at configured intervals
- First cycle completion verification
- Multiple cycle execution with timing accuracy
- Cycle interruption and recovery
- Timing accuracy over multiple cycles
- Queue management under concurrent load

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. Trigger worker pool at configured intervals (1-2 seconds)
2. Schedule multiple services with different intervals
3. Complete first cycle before continuing
4. Handle cycle interruption and recovery
5. Maintain timing accuracy over multiple cycles
6. Handle concurrent services without queue overflow

**Timing Tests**:

- Interval accuracy within 500ms tolerance
- Multi-cycle execution verification
- Restart and recovery testing

**Timeout**: Up to 15 seconds for multi-cycle tests

### Task T044b - Full Health Check Cycle Test

**File**: `tests/integration/end-to-end-cycle.test.ts` **Status**: Complete **Lines**: ~400

**Test Coverage**:

- Complete pipeline execution (health check → CSV → JSON → Eleventy → HTML)
- CSV format validation (RFC 4180 compliance)
- JSON schema validation (ServiceStatusAPI)
- Consecutive failure tracking
- Output directory structure verification
- Multiple service state scenarios

**Key Test Scenarios**:

1. Execute complete pipeline with all passing services
2. Handle mixed service states (pass, fail, degraded)
3. Handle PENDING status on first run
4. Validate CSV format with RFC 4180 escaping
5. Track consecutive failures correctly
6. Generate JSON matching ServiceStatusAPI schema
7. Verify output directory structure

**Pipeline Verification**:

- Health check execution via worker pool
- CSV append with proper formatting
- JSON write with schema compliance
- Eleventy input validation
- HTML generation (structure only, not full build)

**File System**:

- Uses `tests/integration/test-output/` for isolated testing
- Cleans up test files after each run
- Creates realistic directory structure

**Timeout**: Up to 60 seconds for full pipeline tests

## Test Architecture

### Integration Test Characteristics

1. **Real Components**: Uses actual worker threads, real HTTP requests, real file I/O
2. **Network Dependency**: Relies on httpbin.org for reliable test endpoints
3. **Timing Sensitivity**: Tests verify real timing accuracy (not mocked timers)
4. **Cleanup**: Proper setup/teardown for file system and worker threads
5. **Timeouts**: Extended timeouts (30-120s) for network operations

### Differences from Unit Tests

| Aspect         | Unit Tests  | Integration Tests          |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Worker Threads | Mocked      | Real                       |
| HTTP Requests  | Mocked      | Real (httpbin.org)         |
| File I/O       | Mocked      | Real                       |
| Timing         | Fake timers | Real delays                |
| Isolation      | Complete    | Partial (external network) |
| Speed          | Fast (<1s)  | Slower (30-120s)           |

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
pnpm run test:integration

# Run specific integration test
pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration/worker-pool-integration.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration --reporter=verbose

# Run in watch mode (for development)
pnpm exec vitest tests/integration
```

## Known Issues & Notes

1. **tsx Loader Deprecation**: Fixed by updating `pool-manager.ts` to use `--import tsx/esm` instead
   of `--loader tsx`
2. **Network Dependency**: Tests depend on httpbin.org availability (consider local mock server for
   CI)
3. **Timing Variance**: Network latency can cause timing tests to be slightly flaky (500ms tolerance
   added)
4. **Resource Usage**: Load tests spawn real worker threads and make real HTTP requests (CPU/network
   intensive)

---

## Success Criteria

All three integration tests verify critical User Story 1 requirements:

- **T033b**: Worker pool operates correctly under load with real worker threads
- **T034b**: Scheduler maintains timing accuracy and handles cycle management
- **T044b**: Complete pipeline executes successfully from health check to data storage

These tests ensure the orchestrator components integrate correctly and handle real-world conditions
including:

- Network failures and timeouts
- Concurrent execution
- File system operations
- Timing accuracy
- Error recovery

## Next Steps

1. **Fix worker thread loader**: Complete (updated to use --import)
2. **Add local mock server**: Consider replacing httpbin.org dependency for CI reliability
3. **Performance profiling**: Monitor test execution time and resource usage
4. **CI integration**: Ensure tests run reliably in GitHub Actions environment
5. **Coverage verification**: Verify integration tests contribute to 80% coverage target
